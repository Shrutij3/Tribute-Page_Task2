<h3><u><b>Early life</u></b></h3>
<p>
    Son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai family from India who were major industrialists committed to the 
    Indian independence movement. Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942. The couple had two children. 
    His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in 
    science. During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism.[6] He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the 
    University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940.[7] In 1945 he returned to Cambridge
    to pursue his PhD and wrote a thesis, "Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes", in 1947.</p>
    <p>His interests varied from science to sports to statistics. He set up the Operations Research Group (ORG), the first market 
    research organization in the country. Most notable among the many institutes he helped set up are the Nehru Foundation for 
    Development in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA), the Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research 
    Association (ATIRA) and the (CEPT). Along with his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai, he founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts.</p>
    <p> On 30 December 1971, Sarabhai was to review the SLV design before his departure for Bombay the same night. He had spoken to
     A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on the telephone. Within an hour of the conversation, Sarabhai died at the age of 52 due to cardiac 
     arrest in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram). His body was cremated in Ahmedabad.</p>
